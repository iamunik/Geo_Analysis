This project is an analysis project, I was tasked with performing data cleaning operations and also analysis as well as visualising the analysis of the dataset. I performed a JOIN operation using pandas merge function on 3 seperate datasets (excel files '.xlxs') and after the cleaning and merging operations I started with the analysis of the dataset using matplotlib. I also peformed Geo-Spatial data analysis using Folium to visualize certain values on an interactive map.<br>The first set of analysis peformed where just Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand certain columns and view the relationship between columns as well as getting insights to the data and the major aspect of this project was the "Geo" aspect by visualising the data on the map using Folium "<a href="https://analysis-map.netlify.app/">click here to view the map</a>". This project is 100% Python.
